This page is not intended for viewing in browser. I guess you've got there
because firmware upgrade on your WD MyBook has failed. Please do not send
me e-mails that firmware upgrade is NOT working. It IS working.
At least it worked fine for many other people ...
Problem is almost for sure on your side.

I don't have time to provide user-level support.  Sorry. I wouldn't have time to do anything
else than replying to user's requests and questions.
